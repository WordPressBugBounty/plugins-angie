== Description ==

Angie Code: Your expert WordPress developer, powered by AI. Build anything you can imagine without writing a single line of code.

**Disclaimer:** Angie is currently in Beta. While core functionality within WordPress and the Elementor Editor is stable and ready to explore, some actions and integrations with third-party tools are still evolving. We are continuously refining Angie's capabilities and expanding its capabilities. Please ensure you back up your site before use. During this Beta phase, enjoy free daily credits and help us shape the future of AI-driven web creation with your feedback.

Angie Code lets professional web creators and agencies create custom Elementor widgets, snippets for WordPress, and functionality instantly. Simply describe what you need, and watch Angie build production-ready code in seconds, zero coding knowledge required.

While standard solutions provide a vital foundation for most project requirements, Angie Code eliminates the compromise of "close enough", empowering you to build the bespoke functionalities that define the final, most impactful details of your site ensuring every element meets your exact specifications with technical precision.

== Fully configurable inside WordPress & Elementor ==

Angie produces PHP, CSS, and JavaScript, whose output is editable through conversation with Angie ("make the font bigger," "add a hover animation"), or switch to the Elementor Editor's visual controls for pixel-perfect adjustments. You're never locked in - every widget is yours to own, edit, and evolve.

Your existing theme, plugins, Elementor setup, and Gutenberg editor all stay exactly as they are. Angie adds AI-powered creation capabilities on top of your current environment. There is no new platform to learn, no migration required, and no disruption to your workflow.

== What Angie can do ==

Angie's expertise delivers specialized categories of production-ready components:

- **Build bespoke Elementor widgets** - Create custom widgets from scratch and refine their style using native Elementor Editor controls.
- **Extend Elementor widgets** - Inject custom controls and advanced capabilities into existing widgets to expand their functional range.
- **Customize WordPress admin & backend** - Tailor your dashboard, add custom post types, extend WooCommerce, and implement custom hooks and filters.
- **Architect front-end enhancements** - Integrate CSS and JavaScript for sophisticated animations, cursor effects, and immersive interactive behaviors.
- **Construct visual apps** - Build fully functional front-end applications like custom calculators, and quizzes.
- **Generate complete landing pages** - Produce entire pages with layout, content, and styling for Elementor and Gutenberg.

== Multi-modal input and collaborative building ==

- **Conversational building** - Describe the functionality you need in plain language; Angie handles the engineering.
- **Visual references** - Upload a screenshot of a design you love, or provide a URL, and your AI developer will build it for you.
- **Collaborative refinement** - Not exactly what you wanted? Just tell Angie what to change. She understands your feedback and refines the result in real-time.

== Safe by design - experiment freely, deploy confidently ==

Everything Angie Code creates is built and tested in a dedicated preview environment. See it on your page, tweak it, and iterate as many times as you want - nothing is added to your live site until you personally approve it. This is your safety net: the freedom to try anything without the risk of breaking anything.

== Streamline site management ==

Beyond building, Angie acts as an agentic assistant to help you perform site-wide workflows, handle bulk actions, and manage content through simple conversation.

Stop compromising your vision. Start building with Angie.

= 3. Is Angie Code compatible with Elementor? =

Yes! Angie is deeply integrated with the Elementor Editor. You can generate custom widgets specifically for Elementor, allowing you to create unique layouts and functionalities that aren't available in standard widget packs. The widgets Angie creates work seamlessly with Elementor's visual controls, giving you the best of both worlds: AI-powered creation and manual refinement.

= 4. Is it free to use? =

Yes. Angie has a free tier with daily renewing credits, allowing you to explore its creation capabilities every day at no cost. This lets you experiment, learn, and build real projects without any financial commitment.

= 5. How does "Test Mode" protect my site? =

Test Mode is a secure staging environment where AI-generated code runs in isolation. You can preview, test, and interact with your creation without affecting your live site. Only when you're completely satisfied do you manually publish it to production.

This ensures safety and control over every AI-generated element. You can:

- See exactly what code will be added
- Turn widgets on and off to test behavior
- Review what's in production versus staging
- Make iterative changes in a safe space
- Publish to live with confidence

No artifacts are published or affect your website until you've explicitly approved it.

= 6. Can I use screenshots or URLs to build widgets? =

Absolutely. Angie Code supports multiple input types:

- **Text prompts** - Describe what you want in natural language
- **Screenshots** - Upload an image of a design you want to recreate
- **URLs** - Provide a website link and Angie analyzes the design

Angie analyzes the layout, functionality, and design patterns to create a similar, fully editable artifacts for your site. This makes reverse-engineering inspiring designs incredibly fast.

= 7. Do I need to be a developer to use Angie Code? =

Not at all. Angie is designed to break the technical ceiling through conversation. Describe what you want, then refine it through follow-up prompts, just like working with a developer.

"Make it more colorful," "Add animation," "Match my brand colors," Angie iterates with you until it's perfect. You don't need to nail the prompt on the first try. The power is in the conversation, not the single perfect instruction.

The code remains open and fully editable for those who want to customize it manually. You're never locked in.

= 8. Can I edit what Angie generates? =

Yes. This is core to the Angie philosophy. Every widget and snippet Angie creates is fully editable, both through continued conversation with Angie and through manual code editing.

You can:

- Ask Angie to make changes conversationally
- Switch to Elementor's visual editor for pixel-perfect adjustments
- Edit the underlying PHP, CSS, and JavaScript directly
- Mix AI creation with manual refinement

Your creations are never locked or proprietary. They're code that works with your entire ecosystem.

= 9. Is it compatible with my theme and plugins? =

Yes. Angie works across your entire WordPress environment. While it has deep integration with Elementor, Angie Code generates PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. Angie also understands your site's existing architecture and adapts automatically. Instead of replacing your tools, Angie is also an MCP that connects your ecosystem to help you get more from it.

= 10. How does Angie handle site security? =

Angie follows WordPress security best practices. It does not perform destructive actions (like deleting content or overriding core settings) without your explicit confirmation. Because Angie is context-aware, it understands your site's boundaries and works within WordPress's security model.

Additionally:

- All code runs in Test Mode before going live
- You manually approve every change to production
- Code is generated using WordPress coding standards

= 11. Can I connect my own MCP server? =

Yes. Angie is fully extensible. Developers can use Angie's official SDK on GitHub to integrate custom capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Angie to interact with your specific tools and workflows in real-time.

Resources:

- GitHub SDK
- NPM package
- Demo plugin

= 12. Do I need to speak English to use Angie? =

Not at all. Angie is built for creators worldwide. You can prompt Angie in your native language whether you speak Spanish, French, Japanese, or any other major language. Angie understands your intent and generates the correct content accordingly.

Language should never be a barrier to bringing your WordPress ideas to life.
